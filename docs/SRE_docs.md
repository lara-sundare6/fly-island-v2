# CI/CD Pipeline SRE Documentation

This document outlines the Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and other key SRE metrics for a CI/CD pipeline.

## Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

### Availability

* **Definition:** The proportion of time our CI/CD pipeline is available and functioning as expected.`
* **Metric:** `successful_runs / total_runs`
* **Implementation:** We track the number of successful pipeline runs and the total number of runs using Google Cloud Monitoring. A successful run is defined as a pipeline execution where all stages complete without errors. Availability is calculated over a rolling 24-hour window.
* **Monitoring:** We monitor availability across all stages of our pipeline, including build, test, and deploy.  Dashboards are available in Google Cloud Monitoring  **link coming soon*.

### Latency

* **Definition:** The time it takes for a CI/CD pipeline run to complete.
* **Metric:** `average_pipeline_duration`
* **Implementation:** We measure the duration of each pipeline run and calculate the average duration over a 1-hour rolling window using Google Cloud Monitoring.
* **Monitoring:** We track latency for different types of pipeline runs, such as full builds and deployments triggered by code pushes to the `main` branch. Latency metrics are visualized in  **link coming soon*.

### Error Rate

* **Definition:** The proportion of CI/CD pipeline runs that fail.
* **Metric:** `failed_runs / total_runs`
* **Implementation:** We track the number of failed pipeline runs and the total number of runs using Google Cloud Monitoring. A failed run is defined as a pipeline execution where any stage encounters an error.
* **Monitoring:** We categorize different types of errors, such as build errors, test failures, and deployment errors. Error rate trends are available in **link coming soon*.


## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### Availability SLO

* **Objective:** 99.9% of CI/CD pipeline runs should be successful.
* **SLI:** Availability
* **Error Budget:** We have an error budget of 0.1% of downtime per month for our CI/CD pipeline. This allows for some controlled disruption for maintenance or deployments of new features.
* **Alerting:** Alerts are triggered if availability drops below 99.9%, notifying the on-call engineer via PagerDuty.
* **Tracking:** We track our availability error budget using a burn-down chart in Google Cloud Monitoring **link coming soon*. If we are in danger of exceeding our error budget, we will temporarily halt feature deployments and prioritize reliability fixes.

### Latency SLO

* **Objective:** 95% of CI/CD pipeline runs should complete within 10 minutes.
* **SLI:** Latency
* **Alerting:** Alerts are triggered if more than 5% of pipeline runs exceed the 10-minute threshold, notifying the on-call engineer via PagerDuty.
* **Tracking:** We track latency SLO breaches using alerts and dashboards in Google Cloud Monitoring. If we consistently exceed our latency error budget, we will investigate performance bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation (e.g., increase build machine resources, optimize Docker image sizes).

### Error Rate SLO

* **Objective:** Less than 1% of CI/CD pipeline runs should fail.
* **SLI:** Error Rate
* **Alerting:** Alerts are triggered if the error rate exceeds 1%, escalating to the on-call engineer via PagerDuty.
* **Tracking:** We monitor error rate using Google Cloud Monitoring and categorize errors by severity. If our error rate approaches the budget limit, we will conduct root cause analysis on frequent errors and implement preventative measures.


## Error Budgets

* **Availability Error Budget Target:** Maintain an error budget of 0.1% downtime per month.
* **Latency Error Budget Target:** Ensure that no more than 5% of pipeline runs exceed the 10-minute latency threshold.
* **Error Rate Budget Target:** Maintain an error rate of less than 1% of CI/CD pipeline runs.
